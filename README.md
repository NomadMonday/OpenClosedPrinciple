This project is a demonstration of the Open Closed Principle (the O in SOLID).

It is a recreation of this demonstration by Tim Corey, except rewritten in Python: https://youtu.be/VFlk43QGEgc

The Begin folder contains the starting point of the code before the principle is applied, and the End folder contains the refactored code after.
